# dirbn

A script for creating multiple directories that follow the naming convention `"<foldername> <integer>"`.  Useful for efficient directory creation/organization.

Can be placed in `/usr/local/bin` to be called from any directory.  If problems with running occur, try to change execution permission via `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dirbn`.
